Created Tuesday 16 December 2025

IEEE 1800-2023 Section A.2.10, 16.14

cover_sequence_statement ::=
	**cover sequence** ( [ clocking_event ] [ disable iff ( expression_or_dist ) ] [[sequence_expr]] ) statement_or_null

===== Permutations =====

==== Permutation 1: sequence_expr only ====
cover sequence ( sequence_expr ) statement_or_null

==== Permutation 2: With clocking_event ====
cover sequence ( @(posedge clk) sequence_expr ) statement_or_null

==== Permutation 3: With disable iff ====
cover sequence ( disable iff (reset) sequence_expr ) statement_or_null

==== Permutation 4: With clocking_event and disable iff ====
cover sequence ( @(posedge clk) disable iff (reset) sequence_expr ) statement_or_null

===== statement_or_null permutations =====
* With pass statement
* Empty (null statement)
