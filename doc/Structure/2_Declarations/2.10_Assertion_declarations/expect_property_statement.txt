IEEE 1800-2023 Section A.2.10, 16.14

expect_property_statement ::=
	**expect** ( [[property_spec]] ) [[6_Behavioral_statements/6.3_Parallel_and_sequential_blocks:action_block|action_block]]

Note: expect is a blocking property evaluation - used in procedural code to wait for a property.

===== property_spec permutations =====

==== Permutation 1: property_expr only ====
expect ( property_expr ) action_block

==== Permutation 2: With clocking_event ====
expect ( @(posedge clk) property_expr ) action_block

==== Permutation 3: With disable iff ====
expect ( disable iff (reset) property_expr ) action_block

==== Permutation 4: With clocking_event and disable iff ====
expect ( @(posedge clk) disable iff (reset) property_expr ) action_block

===== action_block permutations =====
* Pass statement only
* Else statement only
* Both pass and else
* Empty action
