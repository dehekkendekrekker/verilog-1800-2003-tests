====== nonconsecutive repetition ======
Created Wednesday 17 December 2025

IEEE 1800-2023 Section A.2.10, 16.7.6

nonconsecutive_repetition ::=
	**[=** [[2_Declarations:2.10_Assertion_declarations:const_or_range_expression|const_or_range_expression]] **]**

===== Permutations =====

==== [=n] (exact count) ====
Exactly n occurrences, not necessarily consecutive.
	ack[=3]     - ack true exactly 3 times (can have gaps)

==== [=m:n] (range count) ====
Between m and n occurrences, not necessarily consecutive.
	ack[=2:5]   - ack true 2-5 times (can have gaps)

===== Notes =====
Unlike consecutive repetition, the boolean may be false between matches.
The sequence ends after the last required occurrence.
