IEEE 1800-2023 Section A.2.10, 16.14

restrict_property_statement ::=
	**restrict property** ( [[2_Declarations:2.10_Assertion_declarations:property_spec|property_spec]] ) ;

Note: restrict has no [[6_Behavioral_statements:6.3_Parallel_and_sequential_blocks:action_block|action_block]] - it terminates with semicolon.

===== [[2_Declarations:2.10_Assertion_declarations:property_spec|property_spec]] permutations =====

==== Permutation 1: [[2_Declarations:2.10_Assertion_declarations:property_expr|property_expr]] only ====
restrict property ( [[2_Declarations:2.10_Assertion_declarations:property_expr|property_expr]] ) ;

==== Permutation 2: With [[6_Behavioral_statements:6.5_Timing_control_statements:clocking_event|clocking_event]] ====
restrict property ( @(posedge clk) [[2_Declarations:2.10_Assertion_declarations:property_expr|property_expr]] ) ;

==== Permutation 3: With disable iff ====
restrict property ( disable iff (reset) [[2_Declarations:2.10_Assertion_declarations:property_expr|property_expr]] ) ;

==== Permutation 4: With [[6_Behavioral_statements:6.5_Timing_control_statements:clocking_event|clocking_event]] and disable iff ====
restrict property ( @(posedge clk) disable iff (reset) [[2_Declarations:2.10_Assertion_declarations:property_expr|property_expr]] ) ;
