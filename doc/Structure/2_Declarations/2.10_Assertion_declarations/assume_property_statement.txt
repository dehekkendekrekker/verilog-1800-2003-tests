assume property ( property_expr ) action_block

==== Permutation 2: With clocking_event ====
assume property ( @(posedge clk) property_expr ) action_block

==== Permutation 3: With disable iff ====
assume property ( disable iff (reset) property_expr ) action_block

==== Permutation 4: With clocking_event and disable iff ====
assume property ( @(posedge clk) disable iff (reset) property_expr ) action_block
